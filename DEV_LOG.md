## 2026-02-02

### Notes
- Project scaffold initialized.

### Decisions
- Goal is an engaging, playable MVP first.
- No math integration: do not plan around it or reference it.

### Next
- Define core loop + win/lose conditions.
- Pick target platform (web/desktop/mobile) and tech stack.
- Build a vertical slice: one arena, one enemy, one weapon, one run.
